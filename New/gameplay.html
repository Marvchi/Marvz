    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Dota 2 is a five-on-five multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game. Players control a single character, known as a "hero", from a top-down perspective.</p>
    <p>Each hero has a unique set of abilities and attributes, and players must cooperate with their teammates to defeat the opposing team's heroes and destroy their base.</p>
    <p>The game is played on a map divided into three lanes, each with a set of towers that protect the team's base. Players can earn gold and experience points by killing enemy heroes, creeps (AI-controlled units), and destroying towers.</p>
    <p>Gold can be used to purchase items that improve a hero's abilities and stats. Experience points allow heroes to level up, which grants them new abilities and increases their stats.</p>
    <p>The game ends when one team destroys the other team's base.</p>
